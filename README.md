# AgriTech-USGSLIDAR
The AgriTechâ€”USGS-LIDAR project examines how water moves across a field of maize for farming. For the health and growth of crops, water is crucial. If we have a better understanding of how water moves through a field and whether areas are more likely to be flooded or too dry, we can forecast maize harvest more accurately. Measuring the height of the field at various points is a crucial step in comprehending how water flows through a field. Recently, the USGS made high resolution elevation data, known as USGS 3DEP, available as a public dataset on Amazon. This dataset is necessary to create water flow models, forecast plant health, and increase maize production.

# Goal
The Goal is to produce an easy to use, reliable and well designed python module that domain experts and data scientists can use to fetch, visualise, and transform publicly available satellite and LIDAR data.
